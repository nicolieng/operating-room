# operating-room

## What did we accomplish with this project? 
This data analysis helps our client understand the adoption and the value of a new software product, iSurgery, that they recently purchased. Adoption was measured in a couple different ways such as the number of approved requests, the number of operating room releases, and the number of successful transfers. In addition, the analysis identified opportunities where adoption can be increased through a thorough cohort analysis using cohorts such as location, types of operating rooms, duration of time blocks,...etc.
