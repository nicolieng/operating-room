# operating-room

## Problem Statement
Make a one-page presentation to help us (the company) understand the usage and value of the new launched software product - iSurgery. Provide insights and recommendations on how to maximize the product's value.  

Context: iSurgery is a system designed to let Surgeons free up the capcaity of any operating rooms by providing schedulers the flexibility to schedule or unschedule blocks up to 7 months prior. 

## What did we accomplish with this project? 
To start, I created a number of metrics to measure adoption, such as the number of approved requests, the number of operating room releases, and the number of successful transfers. A trend graph was built for the team to monitor how each metrics are performing over time. One of the key findings presented was that the location of the operation room and the operation block duration plays a key role in determining whether a request will be approved or denied. With this in mind, we can be laser focused on investigating further on the specific locations to understand the root cause of the denials and come up with a respective solution. 

## What to expect in this repository? 
1. A database file which contains the raw data to be used for this analysis. 

2. A python notebook which documents the code used for coming up with the insights, along with an outline of the process, narration of visualizations, and a discussion of limitations and next steps.  

3. A one-page pdf with actionable insights to communicate key findings to out stakeholders and guide them on their decision making. 

## What is the source of the data?
The dataset is shared by a company in the health tech industry.
