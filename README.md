# operating-room

## Problem Statement
Craft a one-page presentation to help us (the company) understand the adoption and value of the new software product, iSurgery, after its launch. Also provide recommendations on how to improve product usage and metrics.  

## What did we accomplish with this project? 
This data analysis helps our client understand the adoption of iSurgery, a new software product. Adoption was measured in a couple different ways such as the number of approved requests, the number of operating room releases, and the number of successful transfers. In addition, the analysis identified opportunities where adoption can be increased through a thorough cohort analysis using cohorts such as location, types of operating rooms, duration of time blocks,...etc. 

## What to expect in this repository? 
1. A database file which contains the raw data to be used for this analysis. 

2. A python notebook which documents the code used for coming up with the insights, along with an outline of the process, narration of visualizations, and a discussion of limitations and next steps.  

3. A one-page pdf with actionable insights to communicate key findings to out stakeholders and guide them on their decision making. 

## What is the source of the data?
The dataset is shared by a company in the health tech industry.
